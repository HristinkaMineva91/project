        <p>Domestic dogs have been selectively bred for millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, 
        and physical attributes.[17] Modern dog breeds show more variation in size, appearance, and behavior than 
        any other domestic animal.[17] Dogs are predators and scavengers, and like many other predatory mammals,
        the dog has powerful muscles, fused wrist bones, a cardiovascular system that supports both sprinting and 
        endurance, and teeth for catching and tearing.</p>

        <p>Dogs are highly variable in height and weight. The smallest known adult dog was a Yorkshire Terrier, 
        that stood only 6.3 cm (2.5 in) at the shoulder, 9.5 cm (3.7 in) in length along the head-and-body, and
        weighed only 113 grams (4.0 oz). The largest known dog was an English Mastiff which weighed 155.6 kg (343 lb)
        and was 250 cm (98 in) from the snout to the tail.[31] The tallest dog is a Great Dane that stands 106.7 cm 
        (42.0 in) at the shoulder.[32]</p>

        <p>The dog's senses include vision, hearing, sense of smell, sense of taste, touch and sensitivity to the 
        earth's magnetic field. Another study suggested that dogs can see the earth's magnetic field.[33][34][35]</p>
